	<p><em>Your grandmother, a once famed adventure, has passed away, leaving you her cabin located on a floating island in the sky. In the time since her passing, her cabin has fallen into disrepair — gather her missing inventions and using them to restore the cabin to its former state!</em></p>
<hr class="divider_line" style="margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
<p>Heirloom is a movement based 3D exploration game created with four other teammates for University. We worked on the project for 7 weeks and presented the final version at a University Showcase to industry partners, members of the community, faculty, and students.</p>
<p>In this game the player explores a floating island in search of their grandmother&rsquo;s inventions. Each invention they find lets players explore new areas by giving them a new movement ability (gliding, double jump, etc). Each invention also restores a memory of your grandmother, and repairs part of her cabin. By the end of the game the player has explored the entire sky island, collected many whimsical creatures, unlocked a slew of movement abilities, and rebuilt their grandmother&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>I worked on design, programming, and modeling for this project.</p>
